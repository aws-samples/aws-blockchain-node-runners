[Allora](https://www.allora.network/) is a self-improving decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) network. The primary goal of the network is to be the marketplace for intelligence. In other words, Allora aims to incentivize data scientists (workers) to provide high-quality inferences as requested by consumers. Inferences include predictions of arbitrary future events or difficult computations requiring specialized knowledge.

The Allora Network brings together:

  - [Consumers](https://docs.allora.network/devs) who pay for and acquire inferences or expertise to be revealed
  - [Workers](https://v2.docs.allora.network/datasci) who reveal inferences
  - [Reputers](https://docs.allora.network/nops) who determine how accurate workers are after a ground truth is revealed
  - [Validators](https://docs.allora.network/nops) who secure protocol state, history, and reward distributions

With these ingredients, the Allora Network is able to continuously learn and improve itself over time producing inferences that are more accurate than the most accurate participant.

Allora Worker nodes are the interfaces between data scientists' models and the Allora Network. A worker node is a machine-intelligent application registered on the Allora chain that provides inference/prediction on a particular topic it's subscribed to and gets rewarded based on the inference quality.

This blueprint is designed to assist in deploying a single Allora [Worker Node](https://v2.docs.allora.network/datasci) on AWS. It is intended for use in development, testing, or Proof of Concept (PoC) environments.

## Overview of Deployment Architecture

### Single Worker Node Setup
![Single Worker Node Deployment](./doc/assets/Architecture-Single-Allora-Worker-Node.png)

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is used to deploy a single Allora Worker Node. The CDK application deploys the following infrastructure:

  - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
  - Internet Gateway (IGW) to allow inbound requests for inferences from consumers and outbound responses from the worker node revealing inferences
  - Public subnet that has a direct route to the IGW
  - Security Group (SG) with TCP Port 9010 open inbound allowing requests for inferences to be routed to the Allora Worker Node
  - Single Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance (the Allora Worker Node) assigned to the public subnet

The Allora Worker Node is accessed by the user internally and is not exposed to the Internet to protect the node from unauthorized access. A user can gain access to the EC2 Instance using AWS Session Manager.

Multiple processes run on the Allora Worker Node (EC2 instance):

  - Docker container with the worker node logic that handles communication between the worker and the public head nodes
  - Docker container running the model server that reveals inferences to consumers

Allora Public Head Nodes publish the Allora chain requests (requests for inferences from consumers) to Allora worker nodes. When a worker node is initialized, it starts with an environment variable called BOOT_NODES, which helps handle the connection and communications between worker nodes and the head nodes.

The worker node (docker container) will call the function that invokes custom logic that handles the actual inference. The request-response is a bidirectional flow from the Allora chain (inference requests from consumers) to the public head nodes to the worker node and finally to the model server that reveals inferences.

| Security                | Network protection                | Are there unnecessary open ports in security groups?                             | Please note that port 9010 (TCP) is open inbound to support requests for inferences from the Allora Network public head nodes. |
|                         |                                   | Traffic inspection                                                               | Traffic protection is not used in the solution. [AWS Web Applications Firewall (WAF)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) could be implemented for traffic over HTTP(S), [AWS Shield](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/shield-chapter.html) provides Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection. Additional charges will apply. |

T3 instances are designed for applications with moderate CPU usage that experience temporary spikes in use. This profile aligns closely with the load profile of Allora Network worker nodes.                                                                                                             |

## Worker Node System Requirements

- Operating System: Any modern Linux operating system
- CPU: Minimum of 2 cores
- Memory: Minimum of 4GB
- Storage: SSD or NVMe with minimum of 20GB of space

## Setup Instructions

### Open AWS CloudShell

To begin, ensure you login to your AWS account with permissions to create and modify resources in IAM, EC2, EBS, VPC, S3, KMS, and Secrets Manager.

From the AWS Management Console, open the [AWS CloudShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/welcome.html), a web-based shell environment. If unfamiliar, review the [2-minute YouTube video](https://youtu.be/fz4rbjRaiQM) for an overview and check out [CloudShell with VPC environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/creating-vpc-environment.html) that we'll use to test nodes API from internal IP address space.

Once ready, you can run the commands to deploy and test blueprints in the CloudShell.

### Clone this repository and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-blockchain-node-runners.git
cd aws-blockchain-node-runners
npm install
```

### Deploy single worker node

1. Make sure you are in the root directory of the cloned repository

2. Configure your setup

    Create your own copy of `.env` file and edit it to update with your AWS Account ID and Region:
```bash
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/allora
cd lib/allora
npm install
pwd
cp ./sample-configs/.env-sample-full .env
nano .env
```
> NOTE:
> Example configuration parameters are set in the local `.env-sample` file. You can find more examples inside `sample-configs` directory.

> IMPORTANT:
> All AWS CDK v2 deployments use dedicated AWS resources to hold data during deployment. Therefore, your AWS account and Region must be [bootstrapped](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html) to create these resources before you can deploy. If you haven't already bootstrapped, issue the following command:
> ```bash
> cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION
> ```

3. Deploy Common Stack

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/allora
npx cdk deploy allora-common
```

4. Deploy Allora Worker Node

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/allora
npx cdk deploy allora-single-node --json --outputs-file single-node-deploy.json
```

5. Test your node

```bash
INSTANCE_ID=$(cat single-node-deploy.json | jq -r '..|.nodeinstanceid? | select(. != null)')
NODE_INTERNAL_IP=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids $INSTANCE_ID --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].PrivateIpAddress' --output text)
echo "NODE_INTERNAL_IP=$NODE_INTERNAL_IP"
TOKEN="ETH"

curl http://$NODE_INTERNAL_IP:8000/inference/$TOKEN
```

## Clear up and undeploy everything

1. Undeploy worker node and common components

```bash
# Setting the AWS account id and region in case local .env file is lost
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=<your_target_AWS_account_id>
export AWS_REGION=<your_target_AWS_region>

pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/allora

# Undeploy Single Node
npx cdk destroy allora-single-node

# Undeploy Common Stack
npx cdk destroy allora-common
```
