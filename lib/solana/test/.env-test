SOLANA_NODE_IDENTITY_SECRET_ARN="none"                            # Optional. The ARN of the secret in AWS Secrets Manager with the node identity key pair. In case you want to provision a node but keep the old identity.
SOLANA_VOTE_ACCOUNT_SECRET_ARN="none"                             # Optional for consensus node type. ARN of the secret in AWS Secrets Manager with the Vote Account's key pair.
