Solana nodes on AWS can be deployed in 2 different configurations: base RPC and extended RPC with secondary indexes. In addition, you can choose to deploy those configurations as a single node or a highly available (HA) nodes setup and use x86- or ARM-powered EC2 instances. See below the details on single node and HA deployment setups.

## Overview of Deployment Architectures for Single and HA setups

### Single node setup

![Single Node Deployment](./doc/assets/Architecture-SingleNode.drawio.png)

1.	A Solana node deployed in the [Default VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html) continuously synchronizes with the rest of nodes on [Solana Clusters](https://docs.solana.com/clusters) through [Internet Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html).
2.	The Solana node is used by dApps or development tools internally from within the Default VPC. JSON RPC API is not exposed to the Internet directly to protect nodes from unauthorized access.
3.	The Solana node uses all required secrets locally, but optionally can store a copy in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) as secure backup.
4.	The Solana node sends various monitoring metrics for both EC2 and Solana nodes to Amazon CloudWatch. It also updates the dashboard with correct storage device names to display respective metrics properly.

### HA setup

![Highly Available Nodes Deployment](./doc/assets/Architecture-HANodes.drawio.png)

1.	A set of Base or Extended RPC Solana nodes are deployed within the [Auto Scaling Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-groups.html) in the [Default VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html) continuously synchronizes with the rest of nodes on [Solana Clusters](https://docs.solana.com/clusters) through [Internet Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html). **Note that HA setup is not suitable for Consensus nodes.**
2.	The Solana nodes are accessed by dApps or development tools internally through [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html). JSON RPC API is not exposed to the Internet to protect nodes from unauthorized access. dApps need to handle user authentication and API protection, like [in this example for dApps on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/dapp-authentication-with-amazon-cognito-and-web3-proxy-with-amazon-api-gateway/).
3.	The Solana nodes use all required secrets locally, but optionally can store a copy in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) as secure backup.
4.	The Solana nodes send various monitoring metrics for both EC2 and Solana nodes to Amazon CloudWatch.

<summary>Managing Secrets</summary>

Upon initialization, if a node fails to locate the requisite identity file on the associated Root EBS volume, it automatically generates a new one. We no longer store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager by default. In the case of a single-node deployment, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret can be specified within the .env configuration file. The node will then retrieve and utilize this information during its startup process.

Base RPC and Extended RPC nodes use only 1 secret:

- **Solana Node Identity Secret**: The identity key pair for a Solana node.

Consensus node uses up to 3 more identity secrets:

- **Vote Account Secret**: The [Validator Identity's key pair](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/vote-accounts#validator-identity).

- **Authorized Withdrawer Account Secret**: The [Authorized Withdrawer key pair](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/vote-accounts#authorized-withdrawer).

- **Registration Transaction Funding Account Secret**: An account that has sufficient SOL to pay for on-chain validator creation transaction. If not present, the node provisioning script assumes the on-chain validator creation transaction was issued elsewhere and will skip it.

<summary>Well-Architected Checklist</summary>

This is the Well-Architected checklist for Solana nodes implementation of the AWS Blockchain Node Runner app. This checklist takes into account questions from the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) which are relevant to this workload. Please feel free to add more checks from the framework if required for your workload.

| Pillar                  | Control                           | Question/Check                                                                   | Remarks          |

</details>

## Setup Instructions

### Open AWS CloudShell

To begin, ensure you login to your AWS account with permissions to create and modify resources in IAM, EC2, EBS, VPC, S3, KMS, and Secrets Manager.

From the AWS Management Console, open the [AWS CloudShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/welcome.html), a web-based shell environment. If unfamiliar, review the [2-minute YouTube video](https://youtu.be/fz4rbjRaiQM) for an overview and check out [CloudShell with VPC environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/creating-vpc-environment.html) that we'll use to test nodes API from internal IP address space.

Once ready, you can run the commands to deploy and test blueprints in the CloudShell.

### Clone this repository and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-blockchain-node-runners.git
cd aws-blockchain-node-runners
npm install
```

### Configure your setup

1. Make sure you are in the root directory of the cloned repository

2. If you have deleted or don't have the default VPC, create default VPC

```bash
aws ec2 create-default-vpc
```

> **NOTE:** *You may see the following error if the default VPC already exists: `An error occurred (DefaultVpcAlreadyExists) when calling the CreateDefaultVpc operation: A Default VPC already exists for this account in this region.`. That means you can just continue with the following steps.*

3. Configure  your setup

Create your own copy of `.env` file and edit it to update with your AWS Account ID and Region:
```bash
cd lib/solana
cp ./sample-configs/.env-sample-baserpc-arm .env
nano .env
```
> **NOTE:** *You can find more examples inside `sample-configs` directory: ARM-powered and x86-powered setups, base and extended RPC configurations.*


4. Deploy common components such as IAM role:

```bash
npx cdk deploy solana-common
```


### Deploy a Single Node

1. Deploy the node

```bash
npx cdk deploy solana-single-node --json --outputs-file single-node-deploy.json
```

2. After starting the node you need to wait for the initial synchronization process to finish. It may take from 1 to 4 hours and you can use Amazon CloudWatch to track the progress. There is a script that publishes CloudWatch metrics every 5 minutes, where you can watch `current block` and `slots behind` metrics. When the node is fully synced the `slots behind` metric should go to 0. To see them:

   - Navigate to [CloudWatch service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) (make sure you are in the region you have specified for `AWS_REGION`)
   - Open `Dashboards` and select `solana-single-node` from the list of dashboards.

3. Connect with the RPC API exposed by the node:

```bash
INSTANCE_ID=$(cat single-node-deploy.json | jq -r '..|.nodeinstanceid? | select(. != null)')
NODE_INTERNAL_IP=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids $INSTANCE_ID --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].PrivateIpAddress' --output text)
echo "NODE_INTERNAL_IP=$NODE_INTERNAL_IP"
```

- Copy output from the last `echo` command with `NODE_INTERNAL_IP=<internal_IP>` and open [CloudShell tab with VPC environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/creating-vpc-environment.html) to access internal IP address space. Paste `NODE_INTERNAL_IP=<internal_IP>` into the new CloudShell tab. Then query the API:

``` bash
# IMPORTANT: Run from CloudShell VPC environment tab
# We query token balance this account: https://solanabeach.io/address/9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM
curl http://$NODE_INTERNAL_IP:8899 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data '{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "getBalance", "params": ["9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM"]}'
```

### Deploy HA Nodes

1. Deploy multiple HA Nodes

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/solana
npx cdk deploy solana-ha-nodes --json --outputs-file ha-nodes-deploy.json
```

2. Give the new RPC nodes 1 to 4 hours to initialize and then run the following query against the load balancer behind the RPC node created

```bash
export RPC_ABL_URL=$(cat ha-nodes-deploy.json | jq -r '..|.ALBURL? | select(. != null)')
echo RPC_ABL_URL=$RPC_ABL_URL
```

- Copy output from the last `echo` command with `RPC_ABL_URL=<internal_IP>` and open [CloudShell tab with VPC environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/creating-vpc-environment.html) to access internal IP address space. Paste `RPC_ABL_URL=<internal_IP>` into the new CloudShell tab. Then query the API:


```bash
curl http://$RPC_ABL_URL:8899 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data '{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "getBalance", "params": ["9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM"]}'
```

- The result should be like this (the actual balance might change):

```javascript
// We query token balance this account: https://solanabeach.io/address/9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"context":{"apiVersion":"1.16.15","slot":221433176},"value":12870473061872488},"id":1}
```

- If the nodes are still starting and catching up with the chain, you will see the following response:

```HTML
   <html>
   <head><title>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</title></head>
   <body>
   <center><h1>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</h1></center>
   </body>
```

> **NOTE:** *By default and for security reasons the load balancer is available only from within the default VPC in the region where it is deployed. It is not available from the Internet and is not open for external connections. Before opening it up please make sure you protect your RPC APIs.*

### Clearing up and undeploy everything

Destroy HA Nodes, Single Nodes and Common stacks

```bash
# Setting the AWS account id and region in case local .env file is lost
 export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=<your_target_AWS_account_id>
 export AWS_REGION=<your_target_AWS_region>

pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/solana

# Destroy HA Nodes
cdk destroy solana-ha-nodes

# Destroy Single Node
cdk destroy sync-single-node

# Delete all common components like IAM role and Security Group
cdk destroy solana-common
```

### FAQ

1. How to check the logs of the clients running on my sync node?

> **NOTE:** *In this tutorial we chose not to use SSH and use Session Manager instead. That allows you to log all sessions in AWS CloudTrail to see who logged into the server and when. If you receive an error similar to `SessionManagerPlugin is not found`, [install Session Manager plugin for AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)*

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/solana

export INSTANCE_ID=$(cat single-node-deploy.json | jq -r '..|.node-instance-id? | select(. != null)')
echo "INSTANCE_ID=" $INSTANCE_ID
aws ssm start-session --target $INSTANCE_ID --region $AWS_REGION
sudo su bcuser
sudo journalctl -o cat -fu node
```

2. How to check the logs from the EC2 user-data script?

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/solana

export INSTANCE_ID=$(cat single-node-deploy.json | jq -r '..|.node-instance-id? | select(. != null)')
echo "INSTANCE_ID=" $INSTANCE_ID
aws ssm start-session --target $INSTANCE_ID --region $AWS_REGION
sudo cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
```

3. How can I restart the Solana service?
``` bash
export INSTANCE_ID=$(cat single-node-deploy.json | jq -r '..|.node-instance-id? | select(. != null)')
echo "INSTANCE_ID=" $INSTANCE_ID
aws ssm start-session --target $INSTANCE_ID --region $AWS_REGION
sudo systemctl status node
```

4. How to upload a secret to AWS Secrets Manager?
```bash
# Create key pair
sudo ./solana-keygen new --no-passphrase -o /tmp/keypair.json
SOLANA_ADDRESS=$(sudo ./solana-keygen pubkey /tmp/keypair.json)
# Upload key pair to AWS Secrets Manager"
export AWS_REGION=<your_region>
sudo aws secretsmanager create-secret --name "solana/"$SOLANA_ADDRESS --description "Solana secret key pair" --secret-string file:///tmp/keypair.json --region $AWS_REGION
#Delete key pair from the local file system
rm -rf /tmp/keypair.json
```
5. How can I add swap space to the instance if my Solana node runs out of RAM during the initial sync?

   There are two ways. Using the existing volume or using a new one. If your instance has Instance Store volume attached, it is better to keep your swap on it.

- Option 1: Dedicated Instance Store volume

```bash
sudo mkswap /dev/nvme3n1
sudo swapon /dev/nvme3n1
# Check the memory space is updated
free -g
```

- Option 2: Existing volume (using Data directory as example):

```bash
sudo mkdir /data/data/swapfile
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/data/data/swapfile bs=1MiB count=250KiB
sudo chmod 0600 /data/data/swapfile
sudo mkswap /data/data/swapfile
sudo swapon /data/data/swapfile
free -g
sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
```

## Upgrades

When nodes need to be upgraded or downgraded, [use blue/green pattern to do it](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/performing-bluegreen-deployments-with-aws-codedeploy-and-auto-scaling-groups/). This is not yet automated and contributions are welcome!
