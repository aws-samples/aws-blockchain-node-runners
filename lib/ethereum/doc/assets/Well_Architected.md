# Well-Architected Checklist

This is the Well-Architected checklist for Ethereum nodes implementation of the AWS Blockchain Node Runner app. This checklist takes into account questions from the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) which are relevant to this workload. Please feel free to add more checks from the framework if required for your workload.

| Pillar                  | Control                           | Question/Check                                                                   | Remarks          |
|:------------------------|:----------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------|
| Security                | Network protection                | Are there unnecessary open ports in security groups?                             | Please note that Erigon snap sync port remains open for non-erigon clients, i.e. Port 42069 (TCP/UDP).  |
|                         |                                   | Traffic inspection                                                               | AWS WAF could be implemented for traffic inspection. Additional charges will apply.  |
|                         | Compute protection                | Reduce attack surface                                                            | This solution uses Amazon Linux 2 AMI. You may choose to run hardening scripts on it.  |
|                         |                                   | Enable people to perform actions at a distance                                   | This solution uses AWS Systems Manager for terminal session, not ssh ports.  |
|                         | Data protection at rest           | Use encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes                    | This solution uses encrypted Amazon EBS volumes.  |
|                         |                                   | Use encrypted Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets                  | This solution uses Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) encryption.  |
|                         | Data protection in transit        | Use TLS                                                                          | The AWS Application Load balancer currently uses HTTP listener. Create HTTPS listener with self signed certificate if TLS is desired.  |
|                         | Authorization and access control  | Use instance profile with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances    | This solution uses AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) role instead of IAM user.  |
|                         |                                   | Following principle of least privilege access                                    | In sync node, root user is not used (using special user "ethereum" instead").  |
|                         | Application security              | Security focused development practices                                           | cdk-nag is being used with appropriate suppressions.  |
| Cost optimization       | Service selection                 | Use cost effective resources                                                     | AWS Graviton-based Amazon EC2 instances are being used, which are cost effective compared to Intel/AMD instances.  |
|                         | Cost awareness                    | Estimate costs                                                                   | One sync node with m7g.2xlarge for geth-lighthouse configuration (2048GB ssd) will cost around US$430 per month in the US East (N. Virginia) region. Additional charges will apply if you choose to deploy RPC nodes with load balancer. |
| Reliability             | Resiliency implementation         | Withstand component failures                                                     | This solution uses AWS Application Load Balancer with RPC nodes for high availability. If sync node fails, Amazon S3 backup can be used to reinstate the nodes.  |
|                         | Data backup                       | How is data backed up?                                                           | Data is backed up to Amazon S3 using [s5cmd](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd) tool.  |
|                         | Resource monitoring               | How are workload resources monitored?                                            | Resources are being monitored using Amazon CloudWatch dashboards. Amazon CloudWatch custom metrics are being pushed via CloudWatch Agent.  |
| Performance efficiency  | Compute selection                 | How is compute solution selected?                                                | Compute solution is selected based on best price-performance, i.e. AWS Graviton-based Amazon EC2 instances.  |
|                         | Storage selection                 | How is storage solution selected?                                                | Storage solution is selected based on best price-performance, i.e. gp3 Amazon EBS volumes with optimal IOPS and throughput.  |
|                         | Architecture selection            | How is the best performance architecture selected?                               | s5cmd tool has been chosen for Amazon S3 uploads/downloads because it gives better price-performance compared to Amazon EBS snapshots (including Fast Snapshot Restore, which can be expensive).  |
| Operational excellence  | Workload health                   | How is health of workload determined?                                            | Health of workload is determined via AWS Application Load Balancer Target Group Health Checks, on port 8545.  |
| Sustainability          | Hardware & services               | Select most efficient hardware for your workload                                 | This solution uses AWS Graviton-based Amazon EC2 instances which offer the best performance per watt of energy use in Amazon EC2.  |
