BNB Chain, is a blockchain that supports EVM-compatible smart contracts and protocols. It utilizes the [Proof of Stake Authority(PoSA)](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/learn/intro#proof-of-staked-authority) consensus mechanism, which is a hybrid consensus mechanism based on a combination of [Proof of Authority (PoA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_authority) and [Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)](https://bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/DPoS).

This blueprint is designed to assist in deploying a single node or a Highly Available (HA) [BNB Chain Fullnode](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/validator/fullnode/) on AWS. It is intended for use in development, testing, or Proof of Concept purposes.

## Overview of Deployment Architectures

### Single Node setup
![Single Nodes Deployment](./doc/assets/Architecture-Single-BNB-Node-Runners.drawio.png)

1. The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is used to deploy a single node. The CDK application stores assets like scripts and config files in S3 bucket to copy them to the EC2 instance when launching a BNB Chain Node.
2. A single RPC BNB Chain Fullnode is deployed within in the [Default VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html) and continuously synchronizes with the rest of nodes on BNB Chain Blockchain Network through [Internet Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html).
3. The BNB Chain node is accessed by dApps or development tools internally. JSON RPC API is not exposed to the Internet to protect the node from unauthorized access. dApps need to handle user authentication and API protection, like [in this example for dApps on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/dapp-authentication-with-amazon-cognito-and-web3-proxy-with-amazon-api-gateway/).
4. The BNB Chain node send various monitoring metrics for both EC2 and BNB Chain client to Amazon CloudWatch.

### Highly Available setup

![Highly Available Nodes Deployment](./doc/assets/Architecture-HA-BNB-Node-Runners.drawio.png)

1. The CDK is used to deploy highly available (HA) architecture. An S3 bucket is utilized to store [User data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html) and othether script and configuration files required when launching EC2 as the BNB Chain Node.
2. A set of RPC BNB Chain Fullnodes are deployed within the [Auto Scaling Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-groups.html) in the [Default VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html) continuously synchronizes with the rest of nodes on BNB Chain Blockchain Network through [Internet Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html).
3. The BNB Chain nodes are accessed by dApps or development tools internally through [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html). JSON RPC API is not exposed to the Internet to protect nodes from unauthorized access. dApps need to handle user authentication and API protection, like [in this example for dApps on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/dapp-authentication-with-amazon-cognito-and-web3-proxy-with-amazon-api-gateway/).
4. The BNB Chain nodes send various monitoring metrics for both EC2 and BNB Chain nodes to Amazon CloudWatch.

## Setup Instructions

### Open AWS CloudShell

To begin, ensure you login to your AWS account with permissions to create and modify resources in IAM, EC2, EBS, VPC, S3, KMS, and Secrets Manager.

From the AWS Management Console, open the [AWS CloudShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/welcome.html), a web-based shell environment. If unfamiliar, review the [2-minute YouTube video](https://youtu.be/fz4rbjRaiQM) for an overview and check out [CloudShell with VPC environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/creating-vpc-environment.html) that we'll use to test nodes API from internal IP address space.

Once ready, you can run the commands to deploy and test blueprints in the CloudShell.

### Clone this repository and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-blockchain-node-runners.git
cd aws-blockchain-node-runners
npm install
```

### Deploy the HA Nodes

1. Make sure you are in the root directory of the cloned repository

2. If you have deleted or don't have the default VPC, create default VPC

```bash
aws ec2 create-default-vpc
```

> **NOTE**: *You may see the following error if the default VPC already exists: `An error occurred (DefaultVpcAlreadyExists) when calling the CreateDefaultVpc operation: A Default VPC already exists for this account in this region.`. That means you can just continue with the following steps.*


3. Configure the CDK app

   Create your own copy of `.env` file and edit it to update with your AWS Account ID, AWS Region, and optionally the BSC SNAPSHOTS URI:

```bash
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/bsc
cd lib/bsc
pwd
cp ./sample-configs/.env-sample-full .env
nano .env
```
> **IMPORTANT**: *By default we use the latest Geth Fullnode snapshot from [48 Club](https://github.com/48Club/bsc-snapshots/blob/develop/data.json) If you want to set your own `BSC_SNAPSHOTS_URI`, check this GitHub: https://github.com/48Club/bsc-snapshots, and use Geth full node link.*

4. Deploy common components such as IAM role

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/bsc
npx cdk deploy bsc-common
```

> **IMPORTANT**: *All AWS CDK v2 deployments use dedicated AWS resources to hold data during deployment. Therefore, your AWS account and Region must be [bootstrapped](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html) to create these resources before you can deploy. If you haven't already bootstrapped, issue the following command:*
> ```bash
> cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION
> ```

### Option 1: Single RPC Node

1. The inital deployment a BNB Chain Fullnode and downloading its snapshot typically takes about 2-3 hours. The Full node uses snapshots data, and downloading and decompressing the data takes time. You can grab a cup of coffee☕️ and patiently wait during this process. After deployment, you'll need to wait for the node to synchronize with the BNB Chain Blockchain Network (next step).

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/bsc
npx cdk deploy bsc-single-node --json --outputs-file single-node-deploy.json
```

2. After the node is initialised from the snapshot you need to wait from another half a day to a day for the inital syncronization process to complete. The time depends on how fresh the snapshot was. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to track the progress. There is a script that publishes CloudWatch metrics every 5 minutes, where you can watch `sync distance` for consensus client and `blocks behind` for execution client. When the node is fully synced those two metrics shold show 0. To see them:

   - Navigate to [CloudWatch service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) (make sure you are in the region you have specified for `AWS_REGION`)
   - Open `Dashboards` and select `bsc-single-node-<node_configuration>-<your_bsc_network>-<ec2_instance_id>` from the list of dashboards.

Alternatively, you can manually check [Geth Syncing Status](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/logs#syncing). Run the following query from within the same VPC and against the private IP of the single RPC node you deployed:

```bash
INSTANCE_ID=$(cat single-node-deploy.json | jq -r '..|.singleinstanceid? | select(. != null)')
NODE_INTERNAL_IP=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids $INSTANCE_ID --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].PrivateIpAddress' --output text --region us-east-1)
echo "NODE_INTERNAL_IP=$NODE_INTERNAL_IP"
```

Copy output from the last `echo` command with `NODE_INTERNAL_IP=<internal_IP>` and open [CloudShell tab with VPC environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/creating-vpc-environment.html) to access internal IP address space. Paste `NODE_INTERNAL_IP=<internal_IP>` into the new CloudShell tab. Then query the API:

``` bash
# IMPORTANT: Run from CloudShell VPC environment tab
curl http://$NODE_INTERNAL_IP:8545 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}'
```

 It will return `false` if the node is in sync. If `eth_syncing` returns anything other than false it has not finished syncing. Generally, if syncing is still ongoing, `eth_syncing` will return block info that looks as follows:

```javascript
   {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "result": {
                 "currentBlock": "0x211f0d8",
                 "healedBytecodeBytes": "0x0",
                 "healedBytecodes": "0x0",
                 "healedTrienodeBytes": "0x0",
                 "healedTrienodes": "0x0",
                 "healingBytecode": "0x0",
                 "healingTrienodes": "0x0",
                 "highestBlock": "0x2123bff",
                 "startingBlock": "0x20910d7",
                 "syncedAccountBytes": "0x0",
                 "syncedAccounts": "0x0",
                 "syncedBytecodeBytes": "0x0",
                 "syncedBytecodes": "0x0",
                 "syncedStorage": "0x0",
                 "syncedStorageBytes": "0x0"
        }
   }
```

3. Once the initial synchronization is done, you should be able to access the RPC API of that node from within the same VPC. The RPC port is not exposed to the Internet. Run the following query against the private IP of the single RPC node you deployed:

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Run from CloudShell VPC environment tab
# We query token balance of one of the system contracts: https://bscscan.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001006
curl http://$NODE_INTERNAL_IP:8545 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001006", "latest"],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```
You will get a response similar to this:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x3635c9adc5dea00000"}
```

### Option 2: Highly Available RPC Nodes

1. The inital deployment of a BNB Chain Fullnode and downloading its snapshot typically takes about 2-3 hours. The Full node uses snapshots data, and downloading and decompressing the data takes time. You can grab a cup of coffee☕️ and patiently wait during this process. After deployment, you'll need to wait for your another half a day to a day for your nodes to synchronize with the BNB Chain Blockchain Network, depending on how fresh the snapshot was.

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/bsc
npx cdk deploy bsc-ha-nodes --json --outputs-file ha-nodes-deploy.json
```

2. Give the new RPC nodes about few hours to initialize and then run the following query against the load balancer behind the RPC node created

```bash
export RPC_ALB_URL=$(cat ha-nodes-deploy.json | jq -r '..|.alburl? | select(. != null)')
echo RPC_ALB_URL=$RPC_ALB_URL
```

Periodically check [Geth Syncing Status](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/logs#syncing). Run the following query from within the same VPC and against the private IP of the load balancer fronting your nodes:

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Run from CloudShell VPC environment tab
curl http://$RPC_ALB_URL:8545 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}'
```

It will return `false` if the node is in sync. If `eth_syncing` returns anything other than false it has not finished syncing. Generally, if syncing is still ongoing, `eth_syncing` will return block info that looks as follows:

```javascript
   {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "result": {
                 "currentBlock": "0x211f0d8",
                 "healedBytecodeBytes": "0x0",
                 "healedBytecodes": "0x0",
                 "healedTrienodeBytes": "0x0",
                 "healedTrienodes": "0x0",
                 "healingBytecode": "0x0",
                 "healingTrienodes": "0x0",
                 "highestBlock": "0x2123bff",
                 "startingBlock": "0x20910d7",
                 "syncedAccountBytes": "0x0",
                 "syncedAccounts": "0x0",
                 "syncedBytecodeBytes": "0x0",
                 "syncedBytecodes": "0x0",
                 "syncedStorage": "0x0",
                 "syncedStorageBytes": "0x0"
        }
   }
```

> **NOTE:**
> - *By default and for security reasons the load balancer is available only from within the default VPC in the region where it is deployed. It is not available from the Internet and is not open for external connections. Before opening it up please make sure you protect your RPC APIs.*

3. Once the initial synchronization is done, you should be able to access the RPC API of that node from within the same VPC. The RPC port is not exposed to the Internet. Run the following query against the private IP of the single RPC node you deployed:

```bash
export RPC_ALB_URL=$(cat ha-nodes-deploy.json | jq -r '..|.alburl? | select(. != null)')
echo RPC_ALB_URL=$RPC_ALB_URL
```

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Run from CloudShell VPC environment tab
# We query token balance of one of the system contracts: https://bscscan.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001006
curl http://$RPC_ALB_URL:8545 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001006", "latest"],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```
You will get a response similar to this:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x3635c9adc5dea00000"}
```

### FAQ

1. How to check the logs of the clients running on my sync node?

Please enter the [AWS Management Console - EC2 Instances](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-2#Instances:instanceState=running), choose the correct region, copy the instance ID you need to query.

> **NOTE:** *In this tutorial we chose not to use SSH and use Session Manager instead. That allows you to log all sessions in AWS CloudTrail to see who logged into the server and when. If you receive an error similar to `SessionManagerPlugin is not found`, [install Session Manager plugin for AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)*

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/bsc

export INSTANCE_ID="i-**************"
echo "INSTANCE_ID=" $INSTANCE_ID
aws ssm start-session --target $INSTANCE_ID --region $AWS_REGION
sudo su ec2-user
sudo journalctl -o cat -fu bsc
```
2. How to check the logs from the EC2 user-data script?

Please enter the [AWS Management Console - EC2 Instances](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-2#Instances:instanceState=running), choose the correct region, copy the instance ID you need to query.

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/bsc

export INSTANCE_ID="i-**************"
echo "INSTANCE_ID=" $INSTANCE_ID
aws ssm start-session --target $INSTANCE_ID --region $AWS_REGION
sudo cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
```

3. How can I check the BNB Chain service log on EC2?

Please enter the [AWS Management Console - EC2 Instances](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-2#Instances:instanceState=running), choose the correct region, copy the instance ID you need to query.

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/bsc

export INSTANCE_ID="i-**************"
echo "INSTANCE_ID=" $INSTANCE_ID

aws ssm start-session --target $INSTANCE_ID --region $AWS_REGION
cd /data
cat bsc.log
```

4. How can I restart the BNB service?

Please enter the [AWS Management Console - EC2 Instances](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-2#Instances:instanceState=running), choose the correct region, copy the instance ID you need to query.

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/bsc

export INSTANCE_ID="i-**************"
echo "INSTANCE_ID=" $INSTANCE_ID

aws ssm start-session --target $INSTANCE_ID --region $AWS_REGION
sudo systemctl restart bsc
```
> **NOTE:** *You can also try the following command to obtain more information*
> - *Check the BNB Chain service status*
>   - `sudo systemctl status bsc`
> - *View BNB Chain service configuration*
>   - `cat /etc/systemd/system/bsc.service`

5. Where can I find more infromation about BNB Chain RPC API?

Please refer to more [JSON-RPC API METHODS](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#json-rpc-methods). The following are some commonly used API methods:
   - eth_blockNumber
   - eth_getBalance
   - eth_accounts
   - eth_call
   - eth_estimateGas
   - eth_signTransaction
   - eth_sendTransaction
   - eth_getBlockByHash
   - eth_getBlockByNumber
   - eth_getTransactionByHash

## Upgrades

When nodes need to be upgraded or downgraded, [use blue/green pattern to do it](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/performing-bluegreen-deployments-with-aws-codedeploy-and-auto-scaling-groups/). This is not yet automated and contributions are welcome!
