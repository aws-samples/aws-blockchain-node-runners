# Instance type settings
# Choose an appropriate instance type to match the cpu architecture. e.g. x86_64 (i8i.large) | ARM64 (i8g.large)
# Some instance types might not be available in some regions.
# If "VET_DATA_VOL_TYPE=instance-store" then choose an instance type with sufficient instance-store disk size to support the blockchain data.
# If syncing from public snapshot, ensure the chosen instance type provides enough disk capacity for download and storage.
# Public mainnet data size ≈800 GB; snapshot ≈498.42 GB.
# Public testnet data size ≈100 GB; snapshot ≈44.72 GB.
# Authority mainnet data size ≈152 GB; snapshot ≈120.43 GB.
# Authority testnet data size ≈24.3 GB; snapshot ≈16.83 GB.
