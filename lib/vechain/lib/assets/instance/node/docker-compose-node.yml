# Any ${var} in this file will be automatically picked up by the values in the shell environment
# To pass variables to docker compose:
# 1. Use a .env file (VAR=value, one per line) in the same directory as /opt/instance/node/docker-compose-node.yml
# 2. Export them in the shell before running (e.g. export VAR=value)
# 3. Pass them inline: VAR1=value1 VAR2=value2 docker compose up
