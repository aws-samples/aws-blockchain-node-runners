# Docker Compose can't expand a single variable into multiple list items.
# For example: PORTS="80:80 443:443" or won't become separate entries under `ports:`.
# To support different application types (e.g. public, authority), we use override files
# that fully define `ports:` or `command:` as needed.
# This keeps the base file reusable and separates app-specific configurations.
