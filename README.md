# AWS Blockchain Node Runners

This repository contains sample [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) applications (Node Runner Blueprints) to deploy on AWS self-service blockchain nodes for various protocols. For more information, see [Introducing AWS Blockchain Node Runners](https://aws-samples.github.io/aws-blockchain-node-runners/docs/intro).

### Documentation
For deployment instructions, see [AWS Blockchain Node Runners Blueprints](https://aws-samples.github.io/aws-blockchain-node-runners/docs/Blueprints/intro).

### Adding blueprints for new nodes

If you'd like propose a Node Runner Blueprint for your node, see [Adding new Node Runner Blueprints](./docs/adding-new-nodes.md).

### Directory structure

- `docs` - General documentation applicable to all Node Runner Blueprints (CDK applications within the `./lib` directory)
